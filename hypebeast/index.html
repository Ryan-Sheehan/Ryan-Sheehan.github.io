      One of the first ways AR could be incorporated into the current Hypebeast infrastructure is in the recent drops page of the app. Generally, these pieces
      feature a prominent picture of the shoe that is being released soon, so what we could do without having to change any of the layouts of these pieces is to add a subtle AR button as I have demonstrated above. When pressed, the user would be able to place a 3D model of the shoe somewhere in the space around them so that they can get a real feel for what that shoe looks like, even beyond what a photograph is able to offer.

      How can we add a virtual layer that enhances a physical one? In exploring this question we can find some AR implications relevant to Hypebeast's physical publications. One of the issues I've always noticed with articles that detail the work of some creative is how limited they are in terms of what work of the artists they are able to show simply due to the physical space on a page. Consider a piece like the one I used here of Samuel Ross's A-COLD-WALL* from issue 17. We get to see pictures of a lot of the designs hanging together on a shelf, but this type of picture hinders the ability to appreciate the a lot of the finer details. In total, the article only has space for 5 items of Ross's line to be seen fully (and this is still with only being able to view one angle). 
      </p>
      <p>
                   By using the page of the physical magazine as an image tracker through which to localize our AR 
      </p>
      
    </div>
    <div class="col-lg-4 col-lg-offset-0 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1 col-sm-12">
      <p>
 component, we can add the ability to view 3D models of any number of Ross's pieces by displaying them in an interface adjacent to the page that is visible through a user's phone as depicted above. 
     The interface would be very low-profile to make sure that it feels like this is a true extension of the article and not an app. While in the interface, users would be able to swipe through pieces and interact with the centermost one (i.e. change it's size and rotate it).
      </p>
      <p>
      Additionally, this use case is not limited to the added functionality of viewing clothes. Think about pointing your phone at an article about Tom Sachs and seeing an interactive space station come to life or seeing a miniature city of OMA buildings crop up around an article talking about their new Innovationen tower. There are so many things that are possible here.

      <p>
      Lastly, we can consider a case in which AR does not put something into the world, but instead allows us to interact with it differently. Say you're in a sneaker shop and you see a shoe you really like. In this case, the shoe's pure aesthetics are the only information available to you unless you came in with any outside knowledge about the shoe/brand/designer. 
      </p>
      <p>
      By introducing a sneaker ID system into the Hypebeast app, we can train an RNN against Hypebeast's already gigantic catalogue of sneaker pictures so that when a user points their phone camera at some sneaker they want to know more about, the Hypebeast app will be able to identify it and then subsequently pull up relevant Hypebeast articles / HBX listings about the sneaker in question.

      These are just a few suggestions about how Hypebeast can embrace what is currently one of the most notable advances in emerging tech. With more time and with access to some of the other creative forces currently at Hypebeast, I'm sure even better ideas would be possible.
